Matlab scripts that generate examples from paper "Design of Affine 
Controllers via Convex Optimization", Joelle Skaf and Stephen Boyd, 
available at www.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/affine_contr.html.
Requires CVX package, available at www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvx/.
Some scripts can take a long time and/or much memory to run; see 
comment headers. Scripts have smaller number of Monte Carlo samples 
than used in paper, to run in reasonable time (e.g., tens of minutes).
Actual numbers used are in scripts, but commented out.

dyn_portfolio_example.m  -- dynamic portfolio optimization.
supply_chain_example.m -- supply chain example.
supply_chain_AR.m  -- function called in supply chain example.
supply_chain_ARMPC.m -- supply chain via MPC.
