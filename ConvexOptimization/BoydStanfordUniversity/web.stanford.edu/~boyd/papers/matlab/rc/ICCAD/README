This directory contains the Matlab code that was used to create
the examples in the paper `Optimal wire and transistor sizing
for circuits with non-tree topology' (Vandenberghe, Boyd, El Gamal).

The code calls the program SP, which is available in 
/pub/boyd/semidef_prog.

example1.m:  clock mesh
example2.m:  combined wire sizing and spacing
