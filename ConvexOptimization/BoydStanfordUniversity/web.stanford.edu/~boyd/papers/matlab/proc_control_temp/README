Scripts:
create_example.m       - creates problem data for numerical example in the paper
example_run_cvx.m      - solves the problem using CVX (for comparison purposes)
example_run_distr.m    - simulation driver for the distributed method (see paper)
example_run_primdual.m - simulation driver for the primal-dual method (see paper)


Functions:
pd_thr_speed.m         - infeasible-start primal-dual interior-point method
opt_equal_speed.m      - computes optimal equal processor speeds that meet constr.


Note: Make sure that create_example.m is always run before the simulation scripts.

Also: For comparison purposes, these scripts require the CVX Matlab software for
      disciplined convex programming, which is freely available from
      http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvx/
