<p>This note is a summary of discussions of a subcommittee of the
Stanford Academic Council Committee on Libraries (C-LIB),
consisting of Stephen Boyd (chair), Doug Brutlag, Sam Chiu, Tim
Lenoir, Assunta Pisani, and Andrew Herkovic. It was presented to
C-LIB on 5/10/99, and to the Faculty Senate on 5/27/99.</p>

<p>The relationship between scholarship and scholarly publication
has changed severely and for the worse over the past decade, due to
changes in both the market and technology of publication, including
an alarming degree of commercialization of scholarly publications
and proliferation of increasingly expensive, for-profit journals of
unproved value marketed to the scholarly world. This is resulting
in a vicious cycle of increasing prices and decreasing
distribution, straining (or breaking) library budgets, and leading
to cancellations of journals and cuts in other acquisitions, as
well as dangerous erosion in confidence in the integrity of peer
review. Ultimately, the flow of scholarly communication is at
stake, eroding the academic mission.</p>
<p>There are four broad issues of concern in scholarly publication:
cost, access, peer review, and archiving:</p>
<ul>
<li>The most obvious alarming trend is a rapid increase in the cost
of some scholarly publications to libraries and individuals, along
with similar increases in cost to academia to use (e.g., to adapt
for classroom use) the work it paid to create.</li>
<li>As libraries cancel journals or cut acquisitions to pay for the
huge increases in cost, access to the output of scholars is
severely restricted.</li>
<li>As (expensive) new journals, edited volumes, and conference
proceedings are introduced, the standards for peer review are
eroded, and in danger of becoming meaningless.</li>
<li>As publishers move toward electronic formats, archival
permanence of scholarly work is threatened by deterioration of
storage media and obsolescence of formats. Future access to, or
even the future existence of, online-only materials cannot be
assured, and copyright (particularly newly- strengthened copyright
of databases) prevent academic institutions from assuring future
access through storage. There is no assurance that an electronic
publication available today will be available tomorrow, much less
at reasonable cost.</li></ul>
<p>These issues together constitute the crisis; it is not just a
Stanford problem, nor is it the particular concern of a narrow
group of fields. It affects us all, in one way or another. Some
fields, particularly those that rely heavily on journals for
fast-breaking research results, are obviously and directly
affected, but even those that rely on other forms of scholarly
communication (e.g. monographs) suffer from reallocation of
acquisitions funds away from their areas of interest.</p>
<p>The crisis in scholarly publication has been increasingly
recognized in recent years by scholars and librarians, nationally
and beyond. Many universities are responding with major changes in
library acquisition, scholarly copyright, and other policies and
practices.</p>
<h3>How did we get here?</h3>
<p>We (academics) create articles and books, with considerable
support from our universities and government agencies, and donate
them to publishers. Moreover, we donate other very valuable
services such as typesetting, reviewing articles, and editing
journals and books. The publisher then adds value by coordinating
peer review, printing or web posting, distribution, and marketing.
Typically, the publisher requires that the creator cede all
copyrights in exchange for this value added.</p>
<p>Technology has very much reduced the value added by publishers:
we can now easily generate high quality typesetting and graphics,
and disseminate our work globally and quickly. We do most of the
reviewing, and much of the typesetting and editing, ourselves.
Publishers add brand name; the reputation of a good journal is
indeed very valuable.</p>
<p>The same advances in technology allow publishers to start new
journals cheaply with economical small-runs, or entirely online;
minimal initial investment means minimal risk in starting a
journal, whether or not there is a need and without regard to
scholarly standards. Due to the hyperinflationary pricing policies
of some publishers and the increase in the number of titles (due in
part to the diminished cost of production enabled by technology),
the subscription basis for established journals is dropping
rapidly, and newer journals stand no practical chance of
establishing significant distribution. Thus the value added by many
publishers is diminishing rapidly, just as their unit prices and
aggregate costs are skyrocketing.</p>
<p>However, we (our libraries) continue to purchase publishers'
output, often at high cost. Often our own students purchase them
back at high cost in the form of course packs. Our colleagues and
friends around the world find it increasingly difficult to obtain
our published work, as their respective institutions are forced to
eliminate subscriptions and trim other acquisitions. The result: at
best we strain our own and our friends' library budgets, thus
requiring cuts of other journals and monographs; at worst, our
precious work will not be effectively disseminated. Either way, we
have failed in our basic goal, which is to maximize dissemination
of our ideas.</p>
<h3>Why do we do this?</h3>
<p>How is it that our scholarly efforts harm our institutions and
degrade scholarly communication? One culprit is ignorance among
academics. All of us know which journals in our field have a good
reputation; far fewer of us are aware of the institutional prices
of these journals or the policies of their publishers. Even among
scholars who are aware of these issues, we find varying degrees of
indifference. It is easy to say this is a problem for the library
and the provost to address, and it is certainly not a problem any
individual can address. More generally, academic reward structures,
based on tradition predating the current crisis, exacerbate the
problem. Personal career benefits accrue from publications and
editorships that in some cases lead to institutional harm. Thus a
sound personal decision, for example, to accept the editorship of a
new (and costly) journal, can undermine your own and your friends'
library budgets, ultimately resulting in a negative impact on the
dissemination of knowledge.</p>
<p>Permanence of archival record and access is a looming
catastrophe for the scholarly record in two ways. The first is the
lack of permanence of electronic formats, such that even
well-preserved data (which is rare enough) may not be useable on
current hardware and software. The other is that electronic
journals (or other resources) may simply disappear. A mechanism for
assuring permanent retention and access to electronic resources is
urgently needed. Further, as publishers try to move toward a
pay-per-use model (an emerging trend of great appeal to the
industry), access may be subject to perpetual fees. Under present
conditions, the scholar as author is not likely to see any benefit
from such fees.</p>
<p>The changes in technology and business outlined above may also
lead to erosion of trust in the peer review process. As new, highly
specialized, and, frequently, expensive journals proliferate, peer
review standards can be relaxed or sidestepped. Proceedings of
workshops and invited collections, with minimal peer review, are
also proliferating. It is becoming increasingly difficult to
evaluate the standards of peer review of unfamiliar
publications.</p>
<h3>What others have proposed</h3>
<p>The attached reading list points to a number of approaches and
possible solutions to the issues raised above. Solutions proposed
range from palliative (e.g., cancellation of duplicate and
low-impact journals) to structural ones. At CalTech, for example,
it has been proposed to de-couple the certification and
dissemination of scholarly communication. Others have suggested a
less formal approach: open community-reviewing of scholarly works
which are freely available to all. Several university provosts have
studied the problem in depth and have come to a basic conclusion:
the key to solving the problem is to change copyright practice.
They propose that scholars, their universities, or professional
societies retain copyright to scholarly works, granting limited
licenses to publishers.</p>
<h3>What we propose</h3>
<p>We offer suggestions at three levels: personal, institutional,
and global. On a personal level, we hope to foster awareness of the
problems among our colleagues here at Stanford and at other
institutions. We urge that scholars <i>license</i> publication of
their communications, rather than cede copyright to the publisher.
For Stanford, we propose the creation of a copyright management
service which would help scholars retain and manage copyrights and
negotiate with publishers. Finally, at the global level, we hope to
refine and promulgate standards for responsible scholarly
publishers (RSP), similar in concept to the Association of Research
Libraries' proposed "Partners in Scholarly Communication."</p>
<p>A responsible scholarly publisher is one that serves, rather
than exploits, the academic world. In particular, an RSP would
adhere to standards of disclosure of peer review practices, fair
pricing, academia-friendly copyright policies, and commitment to
permanent archiving and access. Adherence to RSP standards would be
totally voluntary. We hope that demonstrable compliance with RSP
(in the form of some kind of "seal of approval") will acquire
significant moral weight and market value. Were the idea to take
off, it could go a long way toward correcting current structural
problems. Imagine a scholar several years from now pondering where
to submit an article. She would prefer an RSP-compliant journal,
since her article will more likely be accessible (then and in the
future) in the libraries of her colleagues worldwide. What is good
for her is now good for her university and academia in general.</p>

<h1>Manifesto for Responsible Scholarly Publishers</h1>
<h3>4 August, 1998</h3>
<p>There is a crisis in scholarly publishing that demands
significant changes in the way communication between scholars is
published and managed. The causes of this crisis include commercial
trends in publishing, endemic library budget inadequacies, and
emerging information technologies. The results include intolerable
restrictions on the free dissemination of scholarly communication,
erosion in the confidence of peer review, and grave concerns about
long-term access to scholarly communications. There is an urgent
need to identify publishers whose policies offer solutions to this
crisis, and toward that end, there follows a brief list of critical
policies that define the "responsible scholarly publisher."</p>
<h4>The responsible scholarly publisher supports the integrity and
utility of scholarly work by publicly affirming to:</h4>
<ol>
<li><font size="1">Accept licensing from scholarly authors who
retain copyright ownership, granting the publisher rights
appropriate to commercial exploitation of the work for an
appropriate period of time (e.g. author grants publisher an
exclusive license for a certain medium for a certain period of time
and non-exclusive rights thereafter, reserving certain rights for
the author and the author's institution, society, etc.) In so
doing, the publisher recognizes the role both of the individual
scholar and that of the institution (as environment, host, and
sponsor) in developing the content of the scholarly
work</font></li>
<li>Disclose, publicly and in detail at least annually, the process
by which submissions are peer reviewed including number of
reviewers per article and number of cycles of review; names of
editors-in-chief and panel of reviewers; acceptance and rejection
rates based on numbers of articles received, rejected, revised, and
pending; and timeliness of publication cycle. Responsible
publishers make clear when works are commissioned as opposed to
selected via recognized peer-review processes.</li>
<li>Encourage the broad use and dissemination of scholarly
materials in principle, and in specific by granting global,
unlimited rights of use and copying for most such materials,
specifically including journal articles, after a reasonable period
to accommodate publishers' legitimate need to recoup costs of
publication. That reasonable period may vary among disciplines or
among types of publication (e.g., journal articles being
significantly different from reference books), but the responsible
publisher agrees to waive all fees for use of scholarly materials
after a period of not more than [several] years.</li>
<li>Support indefinite continuity of availability of scholarly
work. In the case of printed publications, this function is
fulfilled by the holdings of the great research collections. In the
case of electronic publication, the publisher must agree either to
maintain permanent institutional access to back issues, once
subscribed, without reference to further subscription or access
fees, or to arrange permanent and unrestricted access through
recognized academic research institutions The publisher must also
make such agreement binding on any subsequent purchasers or
acquirers of the publication.</li></ol>

<h1>Charter for the Stanford University Copyright Management
Service</h1>
<h3>Draft 18 May 1999</h3>
<p>The Stanford University Copyright Management Service exists to
protect Stanford authors' ownership of copyrights of scholarly
materials. Its mission is to help Stanford authors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retain copyright ownership and license publishers for certain
limited rights.</li>
<li>Retain rights to use their own articles in full in course
syllabi and similar aids to teaching.</li>
<li>Retain the rights to publish their own articles in electronic
form on their own Web sites.</li>
<li>Retain the rights to republish extracts of their works in
derivative works (reviews, subsequent articles, etc.) without
having to obtain permission of the publisher of the original
work.</li></ul>
<p>In fulfilling this mission, the principal duties of the
Copyright Management Service are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a continuing presence on campus to acquaint faculty,
students, and staff with issues of scholarly publication.</li>
<li>Offer advice, counsel and support to Stanford authors in
negotiating with publishers regarding copyright and use
issues.</li>
<li>Identify publishers' copyright agreements that are not
consistent with the principles above.</li>
<li>Develop and promulgate standards of responsible scholarly
publishers among scholars, scholarly societies, research
institutions, and publishers.</li>
<li>Support the open - and where possible, free - flow of scholarly
communication and use of publications both at Stanford and
throughout academia in other ways, as opportunity arises.</li></ul>
<p>Efforts at other universities to change copyright policy appear
to have foundered at least in part over faculty concerns about
possible burdens the new policies might cause. This shift will
indeed create a need to support faculty and others in
copyright-related matters, and function is intended to provide that
support.</p>
<p>Further, this function is charged with providing a broad level
of support to the Stanford community in assisting and advising
faculty, staff, and students in the use of copyrighted works owned
by others. This function will involve both provision of educational
materials (along the lines of the Stanford Fair Use web site and
web sites of various university Centers for Copyright Management)
and counseling on case-by-case basis.</p>
