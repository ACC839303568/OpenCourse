This directory contains MATLAB code for the examples in 

H.-H. Chao and L. Vandenberghe, Entropic Proximal Operators for 
Nonnegative Trigonometric Polynomials,
to appear in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing.

example1.m:       covariance fitting
example2.m:       projection on cone of nonnegative trigonometric example
ISproj.m:         entropy projection
toeplitzFact.m:   Levinson algorithm
qmeif.m, qmef.m:  structured positive semidefinite matrix factorization

The code requires CVX (cvxr.com).
