Due: Wed Nov 22 at 5pm. Weight: 15% (of final project grade) <br> 
<br>
For this midterm report, your write up should include a preliminary review of related literature and work. You should aim to demonstrate that you understand the related approaches, even if you have chosen a different approach. <br>
<br>
By this time, you should have figured out the "how-to-do" part of the project. <br>
- If the project is about a novel method, then the report should have the details of the method and an intuitive justification of why you think the method will work. <br>
- If the project is about a proof, then give us the outline and state the missing pieces. <br>
- If the project is about implementing a method, you should have a good idea of the design and have finished a good part of the coding. The report should explain the challenges encountered during the implementation and also include any interesting implementation details. <br>
<br>
The report should have an updated plan of activities for the rest of the project, including any plans for validation of your ideas such as experiments. It should be limited to 5 pages, excluding references, and should be in NIPS 2017 style (same style as the proposal). <br>
<br>
Submit one copy per team through Gradescope by 5pm, Nov 22. It is not required to send copies to TAs this time. <br>
<br>
Grading rubric: introduction (10%), clear problem statement (10%), method (40%), plan for the next steps (30%), writing (10%). <br>
